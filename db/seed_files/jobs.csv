"FUSE Corps, Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL)",FUSE Fellow - Establishing Citywide Gateways to Citizenship,,8/5/2015,Fellowship,"Los Angeles, CA","<p><strong>PROJECT CONTEXT</strong><br /> <br /> Los Angeles is home to one of the largest immigrant populations in the United States, with some reports estimating that as many as 1 in 10 residents are living and working as undocumented immigrants. Of the estimated 800,000 individuals who are eligible for citizenship, entering and navigating this process can be a confusing and intimidating experience. The implications of deciding to pursue citizenship are as complex and uncertain as ever given the President’s recent Executive Orders and the controversies that they have inspired. In order to successfully navigate this rapidly changing process, individuals and families wishing to pursue citizenship need to be supported by a dependable partner who can help them understand the nature of their opportunities.<br /> <br /> Public libraries are trusted centers of community education that are designed for approachability and committed to serving everyone. The Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) has 73 branches across almost every neighborhood and recently launched a variety of programs for immigrant integration and to help immigrants begin the process of becoming citizens. The Library has set up “Citizenship Corners” in all of its branches where immigrants can get information and materials about the citizenship process in multiple languages. They have trained staff in coordination with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services so that they are available to answer questions about the process. They have resources for finding English classes and preparing for the civics portion of the naturalization test. <br /> <br /> LAPL is now working to build on the success that its citizenship programs have achieved to date by substantially expanding service offerings, better integrating those services across the Library system and coordinating more closely with related local and Federal agencies such as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. As major immigration reform continues to play out at the national level, LAPL will need to adapt its approaches in order to reflect the current state of information and opportunities. Most importantly, LAPL would like to ensure that community members throughout the City are fully aware of the support services that are available to them through their local library branch. To help expand services and awareness of the Library’s role as a citizenship information center, LAPL will partner with FUSE Corps to host a Fellow for one year who will work with various government partners and community groups to devise and deploy new strategies for communicating with the public about available services. <br /> <br /> <strong>ROLE DESCRIPTION </strong><br /> <br /> Starting in October 2015, the Fuse Fellow within the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL) will develop a comprehensive understanding of current library programs related to citizenship services as well as the larger landscape of organizations providing similar and/or complementary services. The Fellow will conduct interviews with leaders across LAPL, key individuals in other agencies working on immigration issues and nonprofit advocacy groups. The Fellow will also conduct some brief initial background research on citizenship services programs that are proving to be successful in other major cities. <br /> <br /> Moving quickly from research into action, the Fellow will next develop detailed plans for expanding services and increasing awareness throughout the City. Potential recommendations for the short term may include developing and disseminating case studies of immigrants who have attained citizenship by utilizing Library resources and convening partner organizations to help align goals, plans and messages, as well as engaging with City Council and other local government leaders, to ensure buy-in on LAPL’s positioning within the larger immigration-related landscape. Long-term recommendations may include strategically aligning with other City departments and the Los Angeles Unified School District to collect and measure data and impact of services. The Fellow will also help inform other libraries across the country about LAPL’s innovative programming in order to help inspire the replication of similar efforts in other cities.<br /> <br /> Success in this project will be evaluated in terms of the Fellow’s ability to help LAPL expand services, enhance public awareness of these resources and ultimately increase the number of people benefiting from these centers annually. If successful, the Fellow’s efforts will help ensure that the Los Angeles Public Library plays a central role in helping immigrants throughout the City to fulfill their responsibilities and achieve the status that they need to live and work in compliance with the law. Given the scale of this issue across Los Angeles as compared with other cities, these efforts are well positioned to set a national example for how best to mobilize community resources in order to address immigration issues across the country.<br /> <br /> <strong>PROSPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li><em>Develop a foundation of information and relationships – </em>Conduct interviews with relevant stakeholders to better understand programs, perspectives, goals, responsibilities, concerns and constraints with regard to citizenship outreach services provided by the Los Angeles Public Library as well as other organizations. Research programs and best practices of other major cities to better understand how others have effectively communicated the availability of services for immigrant communities.</li><li><em>Provide strategic thinking and recommendations around communications – </em>Develop specific recommendations for broadly communicating the services provided by LAPL utilizing success stories, partnerships, and data. Have City departments as well as non-profit and advocacy groups participate in development of plan to ensure widespread buy-in, enthusiasm and consistent messaging. Include short and long-term recommendations and a timeline for rolling out various messages. Look for “early wins” to start building the narrative of the Los Angeles Public Library as a leader.</li><li><em>Continue to engage stakeholders, collect information and modify recommendations as needed – </em>Continuously gather feedback from key stakeholders and the larger community to identify what is resonating and what is not and modify recommendations accordingly.</li><li><em>Promote the nature and impact of these programs nationally</em> – Help communities across the country to better understand the immigration-related programming at LAPL in order to adopt similar programs in their libraries.</li></ul><p><strong>KEY STAKEHOLDERS</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>John Szabo, </strong><em>City Librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library,</em> will supervise the Fellow and serve as the executive champion to ensure that this project achieves its full potential for impact.</li><li>Other key stakeholders who will support and advise the Fellow will include:<ul><li><strong>Alicia Moguel, </strong><em>Principal Librarian for the Los Angeles Public Library</em></li><li><strong>Cheryl Collins, </strong><em>Director of Branch Library Services for the Los Angeles Public Library</em></li><li><strong>Edwin Rodarte, </strong><em>Librarian for the Los Angeles Public Library</em> </li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>At least 10 years of professional experience in a relevant field, particularly with a background in public relations, communications, marketing, branding, and/or management consulting.

"FUSE Corps, Office of Immigrant Affairs, City of Los Angeles",FUSE Fellow - Accelerating Economic Development within Immigrant Communities,,8/5/2015,Fellowship,"Los Angeles, CA","<p><strong>PROJECT CONTEXT</strong></p><p>Los Angeles is home to one of the largest immigrant populations in the United States. With his election as Mayor of Los Angeles in 2013, Eric Garcetti re-established the Office of Immigrant Affairs to address key issues within immigrant communities and to help embrace immigrants as vital members of the community. The mission of the Office of Immigrant Affairs is to create programs and initiatives that support immigrant integration through the coordination of city services, outreach and legislative advocacy. By partnering with public agencies such as the Los Angeles Public Library and collaborating with the nonprofit and private sectors, the Office of Immigrant Affairs has brought a more holistic approach to immigrant integration and has been able to extend its reach, particularly in promoting citizenship services.</p><p>The Office of Immigrant Affairs is now working with the Mayor’s Office of Small Business and other agencies to rollout a new initiative focused on helping entrepreneurs and small business owners within immigrant communities to develop and grow their enterprises. Navigating the process of opening or expanding a business can be a challenging undertaking, especially for entrepreneurs who may be limited in their English language skills, educational experience, familiarity with reporting requirements, credit scores, or who may still be navigating aspects of the citizenship process. Immigrant entrepreneurs and small business owners are, however, a vital economic force with the potential to create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles. The Office of Immigrant Affairs is in the earliest stages of developing an array of programs and partnerships to help support business owners to achieve their full potential. To help implement these approaches, the Office of Immigrant Affairs will partner with FUSE Corps to host a Fellow for one year to help ensure that immigrant integration into the Los Angeles business community is embraced and leveraged as an core economic engine for the region.</p><p><strong>ROLE DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>Starting in October 2015, the FUSE Fellow within the Office of Immigrant Affairs will begin by working to establish a comprehensive understanding of the current needed of immigrant business owners as well as the programs that are currently available to help meet those needs and to foster other linkages around citizenship and engagement. The Fellow will help identify areas where service gaps are most apparent or where policy changes might be helpful to foster business growth and promotion of immigrant integration. The Fellow will also work to cultivate close relationships with all of the key public, private, nonprofit and community leaders connected to these issues and to also develop an understanding of best practices currently being undertaken in other cities around the country.</p><p>With this background of information, the Fellow will develop a detailed plan to expand and promote resources for immigrant business owners using innovative approaches to reach both community members and the larger business community. The Fellow will develop a series of recommendations for partnerships, programs and policies that are grounded in data-driven evidence of the economic impact of all proposals. Recommendations should be accompanied by a strategic plan for rolling out services, including short- and long-term goals, staffing plans, financial budgets, tactics for meeting all resource requirements, and metrics for evaluating the impact of these efforts. This plan should be developed in close partnership with all key stakeholders in order to ensure widespread consensus and commitment. To help validate the potential of this plan, the Fellow will seek out and execute opportunities for high-impact / high-profile demonstration projects in order to generate evidence and momentum for building upon early wins with continuing efforts. </p><p>Success in this project will be evaluated in terms of the Fellow’s ability to propose actionable recommendations that have broad, cross-sector buy-in and to compellingly demonstrate the potential of those plans to have a meaningful impact in the community. If successful, this work will enable hundreds of immigrant business owners to achieve their personal goals and also stimulate economic development within some of LA’s most distressed neighborhoods.</p><p><strong>PROSPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li><em>Develop an understanding of the current landscape and a foundation of relationships – </em>Quickly get up to speed on current services, outreach and key stakeholders related to immigrant integration and specifically to business needs and opportunities for immigrants.

"FUSE Corps, Office of the City Administrative Officer, City of Los Angeles",FUSE Fellow - Developing a Coordinated Approach to Homelessness,,8/5/2015,Fellowship,"Los Angeles, CA","<p><strong>PROJECT CONTEXT</strong><br /> <br /> The City of Los Angeles, like most major urban communities, faces a significant challenge in addressing the seemingly intractable problem of homelessness. The most recent estimate on the number of homeless individuals in the City is 25,686. In April 2015, the Office of the City Administrative Officer (CAO) released a report estimating the amount of money spent annually on the issue at $100 million. At-least fifteen different City departments and agencies interact with the homeless on a regular basis even though it is not their core function. As a result, responses to homelessness have often been inconsistent, redundant, unnecessarily expensive and not always focused on connecting the homeless to the appropriate services.<br /> <br /> The CAO’s report, “Homelessness in the City of Los Angeles,” laid out ambitious goals for a coordinated policy on homelessness. As a result of the report, the Los Angeles City Council established an Ad Hoc Committee of five City Council Members to look at ways for the City to tackle the issue. The Committee will provide recommendations as the City begins to develop a new, innovative and integrated set of policies and programs that will move Los Angeles closer toward ending homelessness, not just managing it. Significant input from public, private and nonprofit stakeholders will be essential in ensuring new approaches to programs and services are ultimately embraced, implemented, tracked and measured on an ongoing basis. To develop this important new approach, the CAO will partner with FUSE Corps to host a Fellow for one year who will work across City departments and with various government partners and community groups to help ensure that the City of Los Angeles’ new approach to homelessness includes clear implementation plans and is positioned to become a national example of successful methodologies for addressing homelessness. <br /> <br /> <strong>ROLE DESCRIPTION </strong><br /> <br /> Starting in October 2015, the FUSE Fellow will begin by thoroughly reviewing the research, findings and recommendations of the CAO report as well as subsequent research on various elements of the report conducted over the preceding months. The Fellow will be required to develop quickly a detailed understanding of the various programs, services and costs administered by the 15 agencies and programs that interact with the homeless community – both through established programs and <em>ad hoc</em> responses. The Fellow will also need to become familiar with the various department leaders, elected officials, non-profit organizations, and advocacy groups working on homelessness issues in Los Angeles and develop strong working relationships with these individuals and groups.<br /> <br /> With this foundation of knowledge and insights, the Fellow will help accelerate the development of the City’s new approach to homelessness, which includes establishing a consistent response system for City workers who interact with homeless individuals, putting in place measures for tracking the resources that each agency commits to working with those who are homeless, and identifying an enhanced regional strategy for addressing homelessness. Each element of the policy will need clear goals and implementation plans. Among the Fellow’s specific responsibilities will be coordinating interagency teams, ensuring the perspectives of all key stakeholders are carefully considered, tracking progress toward goals and providing regular updates to key stakeholders and policymakers. <br /> <br /> Success in this project will be evaluated in terms of the Fellow’s ability to help the City adopt a coordinated policy to meet the needs of individuals and families who are homeless across the City with goals and implementation plans for the next 12 to 18 months. If successful, the Fellow’s efforts will ensure a more results-oriented and data-driven approach across City agencies to move Los Angeles toward ultimately ending homelessness. <br /> <br /> <strong>PROSPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li><em>Conduct a thorough review of the current landscape and develop a foundation of relationships</em> – Quickly get up to speed on the research, findings and recommendations of the CAO report, “Homelessness in Los Angeles,” as well as the perspective of all major stakeholders connected to the work.

LADOT,Transportation Technology Strategist,,6/8/2015,Fellowship (Paid),"Los Angeles, CA","<p><br />Opportunity for Los Angeles</p><p>Given its position as the largest, densest metropolitan region in the US, the City of Los Angeles stands to reap the most benefits or possibly suffer the greatest negative effects of the arrival of new technology in transportation, ranging from app-driven services to shared use mobility to the arrival of autonomous vehicles. The skill set that exists inside most transportation departments is ill-equipped to understand and tackle the full scope of possible outcomes.<br /> <br />Currently, few cities are at the table in a leadership role on any of these issues, content to let the market dictate outcomes. The current scattershot approach fosters innovation but could benefit from a more solid vision. Los Angeles has long been a leader in transportation technology, beginning in the 1980s with its investment in ATSAC, continuing with ExpressPark, and most recently signing a data-sharing agreement with Google and Waze. Further, few cities are better positioned than Los Angeles to benefit from the arrival of nimble, first-last mile sustainable transportation solutions because of its lack of a dominant center; its vast dense land use; and its need to capitalize on its investment in a strong light rail spine.</p><p>This work is also consistent with local and national policy direction. Mayor Eric Garcetti recently released the City’s groundbreaking Sustainability PLAn, which has a focus on affordability, shared-use mobility, and safety. The Southern California Association of Governments is including a shared-use mobility scenario in its regional transportation planning analysis. The National Association of City Transportation Officials has begun a conversation at a broad level, developing an initial policy paper on connected and autonomous cars in particular. Investment in a Transportation and Technology Strategy in Los Angeles is expected to benefit the City, the region, and the work of cities across the US.</p><p><strong>Position</strong><br /> <br />The transportation technology fellow will report directly to the LADOT General Manager, with significant input and supervision by the Mayor’s Chief Technology Officer. The candidate will be paid $115,000, with up to $10,000 for travel and expenses.<br /> <br />The ideal candidate has at least five years of experience, strong written and oral communication skills, knowledge of public policy and transportation planning, an ability to collaborate across a wide range of stakeholders on the public and private sides, and an understanding of current and emerging technology related to transportation. The candidate’s background may be academic, public, private, or non-profit. Demonstrated expertise in economics, business, or transportation forecasting a plus. Preferably, the candidate has experience delivering work products similar to the one articulated below.<br /> <br /><strong>Deliverable</strong></p><p>The fellow will produce a Transportation Technology Strategy that will include: <br />· An analysis of the state of existing transportation system, paradigms, and technologies in the City of Los Angeles.<br />· A detailed overview of the state of the worldwide industry, national, and state activities with regards to transportation technologies and developments for internal and external stakeholders.<br />· Strategy describing the major factors likely to influence the evolution of transportation needs and specific policy and regulatory changes the City of Los Angeles could consider, including an action plan and budget for implementation.<br />It is anticipated that the document will be publicly available.</p><p><strong>Scope of Work</strong></p><p>The fellow is expected to work collaboratively with partners throughout the region, including the Southern California Association of Governments and Metro, as well as to understand private sector players, including Google, Apple, Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, and other companies who have signaled a significant shift in business models towards connected and autonomous cars. The work must contemplate the rise of shared-use service providers such as carshare and bikeshare, as well as companies such as Bridj, Uber, and Lyft, to articulate how these business lines are likely to converge. It is also expected that deliverable will include the role of aggregators such as Ridescout and the concept of a mobility marketplace, where consumers may select, pay for, and execute their trip using a combination of modes. Major outstanding questions that the City would like to answer include:</p><p>1. What is the vision for the arrival of these technology providers and vehicles in Los Angeles? What is the expected timeline? What are the upsides for safety, mobility, affordability, and public health? What are the possible downsides to consider?<br />2. What is the role of government in ensuring that these alternatives are available and used by all Angelenos? Currently, access to jobs and education is not shared equitably by those reliant on public transit and those who can afford other options. Twin challenges exist of affordability and cultural barriers. How can we ensure that the arrival of these options does not deepen the digital divide and instead lower the amount of household budget dedicated to transportation?<br />3. How aggressively should the City pursue being a testbed for various technologies?<br />4. What incentives and disincentives exist, including regulation, pricing, and public-private-partnership models, to prioritize a service-focused outcome? In other words, how can the public sector continue to foster the trend away from individual vehicle ownership towards a shared-use mobility model in order to meet the goals laid out in the Mayor’s Sustainability Plan?<br />5. How much should the City participate as a service provider? For example, should the City own and operate its own fleet of driverless vehicles and incorporate it into a digital dispatch? Are there other ways for the City to invest in the marketplace itself and become an early adopter? Is this desirable or necessary?<br />6. Are there infrastructure strategies that will make the City more or less competitive for service providers and manufacturers? For example, are there investments in ATSAC that would facilitate safer outcomes?<br />7. Are there organizational changes that the City should consider or skill sets to target to begin to grow the capacity of the City and region to prepare for these challenges?<br /> <br />To connect the fellow to research, thought leaders, practitioners, and other resources, the GM proposes the creation of an advisory board of 3-5 individuals from the public, private, and non-profit sectors. The advisory board will meet quarterly and to provide input and feedback on the direction of the work and offer guidance on future points of focus and investigation.<br /> <br />It is expected that the initial deliverable will take 7-9 months to complete. At the end of the fellowship, the strategist is expected to work collaboratively with the GM to bring the action plan forward in the city and region, including taking it before the Transportation Committee of the City Council and sharing it with partner agencies.</p>","<p>Interested applicants can visit <a href=""http://www.lamayor.org/tech"" target=""_blank"">www.lamayor.org/tech</a> to sign up for more information.</p>"
