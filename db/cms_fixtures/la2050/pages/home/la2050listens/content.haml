        %h1 #LA2050Listens
        %p #LA2050Listens is a series of community conversations led by local organizations to solicit feedback on LA2050 from a broad and representative group of Angelenos. With an open call for proposals, we asked local organizations to submit ideas on how they would engage their community around the LA2050 goals and reports.

        %p Thirty organizations have launched public engagement events about the future of Los Angeles. These events were conducted in English, Spanish, and Tagalog, reflecting our region’s cultural diversity. Engagement methods ranged from community conversations over basket weaving to a storytelling summit at MacArthur Park, a “sidewalk engagement” session, and even a radio show where Angelenos were able to chat live and discuss their vision for the future of LA.

        %ul
