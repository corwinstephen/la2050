          Our region is a place where every resident has the opportunity to engage and interact with other Angelenos and are empowered to contribute meaningfully in civic processes.

        %p.prose.summary
          In 2050, Los Angeles will be the most civically engaged region in the U.S., with multiple online and offline platforms for residents to voice their opinions and influence elected officials, decision-makers, and local government. Our regionâ€™s voting rates and volunteerism will lead the nation, and an expanded network of transportation options will facilitate the easy flow of people and ideas.
