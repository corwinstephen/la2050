  In 2050, Los Angeles will be the most civically engaged region in the U.S., with multiple online and offline platforms for residents to voice their opinions and influence elected officials, decision-makers, and local government. Our regionâ€™s voting rates and volunteerism will lead the nation, and an expanded network of transportation options will facilitate the easy flow of people and ideas.
